# Cursor Rules for Grafinate

## Checklist Discipline
- Always update `ROADMAP.md` checkboxes immediately when a related step is completed in code, config, or infrastructure.
- PRs touching a roadmap item must include the corresponding checkbox change in the same commit/PR.
- Never pre‑check items. Only check when the feature is merged to `main` and verified in staging.

## Free‑Tier‑First Policy
- Prefer free tiers and zero‑cost options across stack: Cloudflare Pages, Supabase Free tier, Sentry Free, Cloudflare WAF free, GitHub Actions free minutes.
- Paid purchases are not allowed except the custom domain. If a paid feature is required, open an issue titled "Exit Free Tier – <feature>" with alternatives and costs before proceeding.

## Security & Compliance
- Keep Row‑Level Security enabled on all Supabase tables.
- Enforce file upload restrictions (size/mime) and review RLS policies in PRs.
- Disallow committing secrets; use environment variables and project secrets only.

## Documentation
- Keep `ROADMAP.md` the single source of truth for scope and status.
- Update `Overview.md` when high‑level scope or vendor choices change.
